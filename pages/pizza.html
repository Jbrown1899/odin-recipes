            The word pizza can be dated back to 997 AD Gaeta and some say this was when <em><strong>true</strong></em> culture was born.

            <strong>Ingrediants</strong>
            <ul class="recipetable">
                <li>4.5 cups bread flour</li>
                <li>1.5 cups warm to hot water</li>
                <li>1 packet yeast</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>1.5 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>Pizza Stone</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Recipe</strong>
            <ol class="recipetable">
                <li>Place a pizza stone in oven and pre-heat the oven to the highest setting.</li>
                <li>Combine dry ingredients in stand mixer and mix with dough hook.</li>
                <li>When mixed slowly add the wet ingredients, save a tablespoon of olive oil for later.</li>
                <li>When mixed into a ball (you'll know it's right when your motor starts to sound like it's working harder) remove it and knead lightly with a bit more flour. Put the dough ball into a glass or metal bowl that's been lined with that olive oil.</li>
                <li>Fill a large container with about a 1/2 gallon of the hottest water you can. Rest the bowl in that hot water and wait for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>After the dough has risen for an hour, cut it in half and roll out each half to make 1 pizza. The ball will make two pizzas.</li>
                <li>Use two cutting boards, one for dough rolling with lots of flour and one to sprinkle corn meal onto so the freshly rolled dough can slide right into the oven.</li>
                <li>Add desired toppings</li>
                <li>cook until desired doneness is achieved</li>
            </ol>
